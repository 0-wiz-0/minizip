Fork of minizip contrib in zlib that includes:

- AES encryption
- I/O buffering
- PKWARE disk spanning

It also has the latest bug fixes that having been found all over the internet including the minizip forum and zlib developer's mailing list.

AES Encryption

+ Requires all files in the aes folder
+ Requires #define HAVE_AES

When using the zip library with password protection it will default to AES 256-bit encryption. 
When using the unzip library it will automatically use AES when applicable. 

I/O Buffering

    ourbuffer_t buffered = {0};
    zlib_filefunc64_def fileFunc64 = {0};
    
    fill_win32_filefunc64W(&buffered->filefunc64);
    fill_buffer_filefunc64(&fileFunc64, buffered);
    
    unzOpen2_64(wFilename, &fileFunc64)
